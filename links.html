                Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency invented by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to 
                create a payment system that is instant, fun, and free from traditional banking fees. Dogecoin features the face 
                of the Shiba Inu dog from the "Doge" meme as its logo and namesake.

                fast and cheap. Its volatile price–found by looking at BTCUSD–has made it a favorite of high-stakes,
