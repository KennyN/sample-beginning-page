            Welcome to my first webpage for this class! I guess I should start putting down some stuff about me. I'm 20 years old and I love learning new things and design. I used to do a lot of web design back in high school but I believe taking this class
             can help me remember since I want to look into building applications via Electron since everything is rendered in a browser and uses html/css/js. I have a lot of graphic design experiene so hopefully I'll be able to integrate that into my work here.
        </p>

        <p class = "BodyParagraph">
            Here is some fun things to know about me! I like plaing videos games and graphic design. I've been designing stuff since I was about 14 when I designed YouTube thumbnails for fun. Gradually I got better and now I can do it to a point where I can make
             some money here and there. I really enjoy coding as well as my first programming language I learned was Javascript followed by Python. I'm sure I'll be able to use some JS later in this class. 
        </p>
